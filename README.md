# NST-histological-images
## Project

This project consists into creating a histological slide by using a stain-style transfer.
That's can be done using a Neural Style Transfer network and using as style image a histological slide stained with hematoxylin-eosin and as content image a slide with no stain. 
The image were preprocessed in order to be coincident, so the only difference between the two image is the presence of the stain.
